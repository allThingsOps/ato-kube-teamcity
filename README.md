# Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery Pipelines for Kubernetes with TeamCity

<p align="center">
Kubernetes allows teams to “abstract” themselves from using and being dependent on bare metal servers. With the help of Kubernetes, users get a consistent, continuous service: IT teams can stop using any server at any time, take it away for maintenance, and then put it back.

Kubernetes also allows you to optimize resources by launching several tasks on the same server.

With TeamCity and Kubernetes integration, operations teams don’t need to choose between over-provisioning and risking a reduced server availability when contention for resources increases.
